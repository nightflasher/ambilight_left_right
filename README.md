This is the simplest way of a two sided (for example on a tv or computer monitor) AMBILIGHT system.
Please refere to this instructable page https://www.instructables.com/Java-Microcontroller-LED-TV-Ambient-Light/ to build up the circuitry, 
which then is controlled by this little arduino script.

This was my first ambilight clone, which was controlled by the easyVDR system, when i launched XBMC/KODI (couldn't get the boblight-vdr-plugin to work).

I took the 12V power for the LED strips from one of the 5.25" power connectors in my vdr system, you have to be very careful by doing so!
